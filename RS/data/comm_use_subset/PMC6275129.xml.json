In addition to viral infections, bacterial colonisation of the airways in neonates with certain species of bacteria, particularly Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, has been shown to be associated with the development of childhood asthma [4, 5]. It has been hypothesised that viral infections may sustainably alter epithelial function, increasing the risk for chronic airway disease [6], and that changes in microbial diversity may play a role, particularly in symptomatic infants [7, 8]. It has also been recognised that the airway microbiota in patients with asthma exhibit distinct differences compared with healthy subjects [9\u201311]. Bacterial airway colonisation seems to influence and modulate respiratory morbidity in various conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [12\u201314].",

Antimicrobial exposure and vaccinations, as well as tobacco smoke exposure, can lead to changes in the airway microbiota [15, 16]. In a prospective cohort study, we investigated the nasal microbiota in infants longitudinally during the first year of life [17], in the absence of acute respiratory tract infections (ARI). We showed that the composition of nasal microbiota in infants is highly dynamic and seems to be predominantly influenced by age and season. However, little is known about how and to what degree ARIs, which are often caused by viruses, influence the dynamically changing microbiota. Interactions between viruses and bacteria are well known [18], but their relationship to respiratory symptoms is not completely understood. Recently, Korten\net al. [7] demonstrated for human rhinovirus (HRV) that the microbiota primarily changes in cases of symptomatic ARI, but not in cases of asymptomatic HRV colonisation. In the study by Korten\net al. [7], nasal swabs were taken biweekly throughout the first year of life irrespective of presence or absence of symptoms and not necessarily at the onset of the very first ARI. Bosch\net al. [19] observed an advanced \u201cmicrobiota age\u201d in infants with more frequent ARIs in the first year of life. Thus, we hypothesise that the first symptomatic viral infection in infection-na\u00efve infants may induce distinct changes in microbiota following commonly observed respiratory viruses. We also hypothesise that distinct clusters of infants with specific microbial response patterns can be identified, which could be associated with severity of clinical symptom response and host risk factors, such as risk for atopy, as suggested by Teo\net al. [5].",

The study was approved by the local ethics committees (Ethics Committee of the Canton of Bern and Ethics Committee of Basel (EKBB)). Informed written parental consent was obtained prior to enrolment in the study. Infants from this prospective birth cohort were followed by weekly standardised telephone interviews, as previously described [21]. Parents were advised to call the study team as soon as their child presented with symptoms of an ARI, which was defined as more than two consecutive days of cough and/or wheeze accompanied by fever (>38\u00b0C), rhinitis, otitis media or pharyngitis [20]. Nasal swabs were taken at the onset of the ARI (swab A) and 3 weeks later (swab B), as described in the supplementary methods. Nasal swabs were analysed by real-time PCR assays targeting five different respiratory viruses (human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/EV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV) and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV)), which have been shown to be the most common viruses in our population [2]. Details on the methods of viral analysis are provided in the supplementary methods. The results of viral studies of a subset of infants, also reported in this study, have been reported previously [2]. Infants were regarded to be at an increased risk for atopy if the infants' mother, father or siblings were suffering from eczema, allergic rhinitis or allergic asthma. Extensive data on several host factors were collected using questionnaires [20].",

In clusters of infants with persistent symptoms 3 weeks after the onset of infection the microbiota was dominated by Moraxellaceae and Streptococcaceae. A higher abundance of these two potentially pathogenic bacterial families might result in an ARI with sustained symptoms. This is in accordance with a recent study of young children showing an exaggerated inflammatory response to RSV in the presence of nasopharyngeal microbiota enriched with H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae [8]. In contrast, in cluster B2, in which infants had fewer symptoms, the microbiota contained higher abundances of Corynebacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae. These organisms have similarly been identified by Teo\net al. [5] to be associated with respiratory health [19]. Nasopharyngeal Staphylococcus aureus was found to be associated with lower disease severity in RSV infections [8]. Biesbroek\net al. [23] and Bosch\net al. [19] reported less ARI in infants with nasopharyngeal microbiota dominated by Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum. Whether these organisms are simply biomarkers indicating respiratory health, or whether they have immediate protective effects on the respiratory tract, remains unclear. Cluster B2 was also characterised by higher bacterial diversity compared to the other clusters. Lower diversity in infants with longer persistence of symptoms could reflect an outgrowth of certain potentially pathogenic bacterial families, e.g. Moraxellaceae, or potentially a lack of beneficial microbiota. It has been shown that the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by dendritic cells is higher after stimulation by M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae compared to Prevotella strains, common commensals of the respiratory tract microbiota. Co-stimulation with Prevotella reduces the H. influenzae-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [25]. This could indicate that commensals, such as Prevotella and others, are not only filling a niche, but are also functionally important for the maintenance of \u201chealthy\u201d equilibrium. In a recent study, we observed that a lower bacterial diversity was associated with more frequent HRV infections in the first year of life [26].",
