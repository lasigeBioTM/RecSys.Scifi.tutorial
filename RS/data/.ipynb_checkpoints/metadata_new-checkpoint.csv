The virus causing SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and multiple genomic sequences have been revealed since mid-April, 2003. After a quiet summer and fall in 2003, the newly emerged SARS cases in Asia, particularly the latest cases in China, are reinforcing a wide-spread belief that the SARS epidemic would strike back. With the understanding that SARS-CoV might be with humans for years to come, knowledge of the evolutionary mechanism of the SARS-CoV, including its mutation rate and emergence time, is fundamental to battle this deadly pathogen. To date, the speed at which the deadly virus evolved in nature and the elapsed time before it was transmitted to humans remains poorly understood. RESULTS: Sixteen complete genomic sequences with available clinical histories during the SARS outbreak were analyzed. After careful examination of multiple-sequence alignment, 114 single nucleotide variations were identified. To minimize the effects of sequencing errors and additional mutations during the cell culture, three strategies were applied to estimate the mutation rate by 1) using the closely related sequences as background controls; 2) adjusting the divergence time for cell culture; or 3) using the common variants only. The mutation rate in the SARS-CoV genome was estimated to be 0.80 – 2.38 × 10(-3 )nucleotide substitution per site per year which is in the same order of magnitude as other RNA viruses. The non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates were estimated to be 1.16 – 3.30 × 10(-3 )and 1.67 – 4.67 × 10(-3 )per site per year, respectively. The most recent common ancestor of the 16 sequences was inferred to be present as early as the spring of 2002. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated mutation rates in the SARS-CoV using multiple strategies were not unusual among coronaviruses and moderate compared to those in other RNA viruses. All estimates of mutation rates led to the inference that the SARS-CoV could have been with humans in the spring of 2002 without causing a severe epidemic.",2004-06-28,"Zhao, Zhongming; Li, Haipeng; Wu, Xiaozhuang; Zhong, Yixi; Zhang, Keqin; Zhang, Ya-Ping; Boerwinkle, Eric; Fu, Yun-Xin",BMC Evol Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e9c78584c08ba79d735e150eff98297eb57f12dd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4a228865af2c19adf9386a5b04cca3ceb3c8683d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cdb29ec7a9029d22f6fbf7ee04543819591acdc2.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC446188.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC446188/,

We aimed to prospectively determine whether nasal microbiota changes occur between the onset of the first symptomatic ARI in the first year of life and 3 weeks later, and to explore possible associations with the duration of respiratory symptoms, as well as with host, environmental and viral factors. Nasal microbiota of 167 infants were determined at both time-points by 16S ribosomal RNA-encoding gene PCR amplification and subsequent pyrosequencing. Infants were clustered based on their nasal microbiota using hierarchical clustering methods at both time-points. We identified five dominant infant clusters with distinct microbiota at the onset of ARI but only three clusters after 3 weeks. In these three clusters, symptom persistence was overrepresented in the Streptococcaceae-dominated cluster and underrepresented in the cluster dominated by “Others” (p<0.001). Duration of symptoms was not associated with the type of respiratory virus. Infants with prolonged respiratory symptoms after their first ARI tend to exhibit distinct microbial compositions, indicating close microbiota–host interactions that seem to be of importance for symptom persistence and recovery.",2018-12-03,"Neumann, Roland P.; Hilty, Markus; Xu, Binbin; Usemann, Jakob; Korten, Insa; Mika, Moana; Müller, Loretta; Latzin, Philipp; Frey, Urs",ERJ Open Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6a2d45016115d187120a5c232f671df30422870b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/81c92759c804f01629de5c8499535a5b300b5f16.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6275129.xml.json,,54458948.0

SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.",25 Aug 2000,"Crouch, Erika C",Respir Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/06ced00a5fc04215949aa72528f2eeaae1d58927.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC59549.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC59549/,
